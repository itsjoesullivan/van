On-the-fly docco document generation.

##tl;dr

Install this Chrome extension to automatically parse docco-style source code
when it's on the screen--i.e. when visiting a page like
[this](https://raw.github.com/jashkenas/backbone/master/backbone.js)

Documentation solutions are not what they could be. Few projects have very
high-quality externally-facing documentaton, and documentation as an internal
development tool is a much more sorry state of affairs.
