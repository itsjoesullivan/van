<p>On-the-fly docco document generation.</p>
<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p>Install this Chrome extension to automatically parse docco-style source code
when it&#39;s on the screen--i.e. when visiting a page like
<a href="https://raw.github.com/jashkenas/backbone/master/backbone.js">this</a>.</p>
<p>Documentation solutions are not what they could be. Few projects have very
high-quality externally-facing documentaton, and documentation as an internal
development tool is a much sorrier state of affairs.</p>
<p>The two biggest areas of friction in documentation writing are:</p>
<ol>
<li>No one wants to write documentation</li>
<li>No one wants extra build steps</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enter Docco</h2>
<p><em>No one wants to write documentation</em></p>
<p><a href="http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/">Docco</a> is an excellent documentation tool:
write markdown in comments in your code, run it through Docco, and you&#39;ve got a
directory of html containing a good-looking view of that code and its documentation. 
This lets you write your code and documentation together.</p>
<p>But what to do with that directory? Particularly if this is <em>internal</em>
documentation, shoving it in your app&#39;s public static folder isn&#39;t gonna happen.</p>
<h2>Enter Doctor</h2>
<p><em>No one wants extra build steps</em></p>
<p>Doctor lets you skip that build step by shoving Docco into the browser. 
As soon as you browse to a piece of Docco-friendly source code <strong>doctor</strong> kicks
into gear, parses out the markdown, and renders the page as the html file docco
<em>would</em> have spit out.</p>
<p>Why not <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ilikdighfoieecgeiffoekahmpjoekii">give doctor</a> a shot?</p>
