#Why scat?

## What is scat?

Scat is a tool for songwriters. I polled my songwriter friends about their process, in particular what gets in the way of them and their songwriting, and came away with some insights:

- Songwriters write lyrics down
- They record musical ideas on a tape recorder
- The difficulty of managing/organizing these dual media gets in the way of progress

So scat.io provides a home for both. Have a lyric idea? Write it down in a scat doc. Want to record a melody? Record that idea in the very same document.
