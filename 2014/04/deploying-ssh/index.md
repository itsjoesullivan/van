# Deploying the easy hard medium-difficulty way

"I was born into what you might describe as the lower-upper-middle class." -- George Orwell

When I first start a project, deployment can be as simple as:

```bash
sv
```

- sv is mapped to "harp server", so <code>sv</code> launches a static server
- As I am the only consumer of this work, it's effectively deployed to the entire audience
- The project is simple enough to be served statically.
