    <p>Schroeder is a hardware music keyboard built on a web stack.</p>
    <h2>The stack</h2>
    <p>Under the cover is a Chromebox running an app I developed 'specially for schroeder</p>
    <p>The other hardware is a midi keyboard ( <a target="_blank" href="http://www.korg.com/us/products/controllers/microkey/">a Korg microKEY 25</a> ), an amp and speaker, and a wooden case.</p>

    <h3>The app</h3>
    <p>The app is a Chrome packaged app. It uses the USB API to listen to the keyboard (<a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/itsjoesullivan/8064641">here's a gist to the code for that</a>), maps notes/velocity to audio files, and uses the Web Audio API to play them.</p>

    <h3>The sound</h3>
    <p>Much as I'd have liked to record a wurlitzer myself, I ended up sampling the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keys/scarbee-a200/artists/">Scarbee A-200</a> virtual instrument instead.</p>
